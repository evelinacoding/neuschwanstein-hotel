    <p>Tucked within the castle walls, the shop offers visitors a chance to take a piece of Neuschwanstein’s magic home. Shelves are lined with hand-crafted souvenirs inspired by King Ludwig II’s fairy-tale vision—ornate glassware, porcelain figurines, and locally made woodcarvings that echo the region’s Alpine heritage. Exclusive prints and books reveal the castle’s history, while gourmet treats like Bavarian chocolates and schnapps showcase flavors of the region. Blending elegance with tradition, the shop feels less like a tourist stop and more like a curated gallery of royal keepsakes.</p>
